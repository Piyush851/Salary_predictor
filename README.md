# 💼 Salary Predictor

A machine learning web application that predicts an employee's salary based on demographic and professional attributes such as age, gender, education, job title, and years of experience.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed during my Artificial Intelligence internship at **Edunet Foundation**. The goal was to build a data-driven solution that could estimate employee salaries using supervised learning techniques. The model is built using **Python**, and a simple web interface is developed using **Flask**.

## 🧠 Features

- Predicts salary based on user inputs
- Trained on real-world data
- Preprocessing using `pandas` and `scikit-learn`
- Lightweight and easy-to-use Flask-based web app
- Scalable design for future feature additions

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Area             | Technology                     |
|------------------|--------------------------------|
| Programming      | Python                         |
| Web Framework    | Flask                          |
| ML Libraries     | Scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy    |
| Model Storage    | joblib                         |
| Frontend         | HTML, CSS                      |

## 📊 Input Features

- **Age**: Employee's age
- **Gender**: Male / Female
- **Education**: Education level
- **Job Title**: Type of job/role
- **Years of Experience**: Work experience in years

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User provides the required inputs through the form on the web interface.
2. The input is preprocessed and fed to a trained regression model.
3. The model returns the predicted salary, which is displayed to the user.
